    <p class="text-lg mb-6">
      After its premiere at the Berlin Philharmonie, Amir Shpilman’s <em>Kriat Shema – Fantasy for Shofar and Orchestra</em> found a new stage in Thuringia. On September 18, 2025, the Thuringia Philharmonic Gotha-Eisenach presented the concert 
      <em>“Magic of the Shofar”</em> as part of the <strong>Achava Festival Thuringia</strong>. 
      The evening combined tradition, ritual, and symphonic innovation, with Shpilman’s 
      <em>Kriat Shema – Fantasy for Shofar and Orchestra</em> opening the program.

      The concert opened with Shpilman’s work, a bold encounter between the primal voice of the 
      shofar and the symphonic forces of the orchestra. Conducted by <strong>Markus Huber</strong> 
      and featuring <strong>Bar Zemach</strong> as shofar soloist, the performance set the tone 
      for an evening that bridged ancient sound and modern orchestral color.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
      The program continued with Reinhold Glière’s <em>Horn Concerto</em> in B-flat major, performed by 
      <strong>Rita Huber</strong>, before concluding with Dmitri Shostakovich’s expansive 
      <em>Symphony No. 6 in B minor</em>. The balance of contemporary creation and established repertoire 
      framed Shpilman’s premiere as both radical and rooted.
